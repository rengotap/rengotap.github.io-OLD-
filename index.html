                    Team Kilo has brain stormed a group of ideas that will provide users with a fun and effective way to practice their art.
                    <br> Our catagories cover broad topics that cover the basics of how users will interact with us, our program, and eachother through our service.
                    <br> Additionally, the group discussed the monetary implications and perks that would come with a paid "premium user" experience.
